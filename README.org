* debug-mode-mode
debug-mode-mode provides a live-debugging like environment for emacs.

Simply tell it what variables and functions to watch and then call live-debug. Then watch the magic happen. Or don't it's not that magical or entertaining

How it works:
1. Tell debug-mode-mode what state you want to watch and how you want to display it.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Watch some state to do with multiple-cursors
  (setq debug-mode-watch-variables '(mc--current-cursor-id)) 
#+END_SRC

2. Then you tell it what functions you want to watch
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   ;; Watch some state with multiple cursors and cursor movement
   (setq debug-mode-watch-functions '(multiple-cursors-mode mc/create-cursor-id right-char left-char previous-line next-line yank))
#+END_SRC

3. Call ~live-debug~ function
